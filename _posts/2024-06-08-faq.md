# About
There are many review blogs that go over the experience that people have had with the CPTS exam, and while they do cover a lot of what someone might need to know about starting their journey, I still find that I'm having to re-answer a lot of the same questions. This blog post is meant to fully answer the most common questions that might not really fit in other 'review' style blog posts about CPTS.

# Questions:

## What do I need to do, in order to take the exam?

In order to be eligible to take the exam, you must first complete the entire [Penetration Tester](https://academy.hackthebox.com/paths/jobrole) job role path. There is currently no way to bypass this.


## If I finished the Penetration Tester job role path, and new content is added to modules in the path, do I have to complete them before I can take the exam?

No - at this time, as long as you have reached completion of the path at any point, you do not need to complete any updated content.


## There are many options/plans for purchasing/accessing modules - which one should I use?

If your intention is to only do the CPTS certification, the most efficient way to do this is to purchase 1 month of the 'Platinum' plan ($68 for 1000 cubes), and then 1 month of the 'Gold' plan ($38 for 500 cubes). This will be enough for 1500 cubes, and while the Penetration Tester path is 2000 cubes total, each module completed in the HackTheBox Academy will refund a percentage of the cubes. The two months of subscription should be enough for you to go through the whole path.

If your plan is to also do additional modules in the CBBH/CDSA certification paths, the 'Silver Annual' ($490) plan might be a better idea, as rather than giving you cubes to use, this plan simply unlocks access to all modules up to Tier 2 for the duration of the plan. Any modules you complete during this plan will be yours to keep. The cost of this plan also includes 1 exam voucher ($210 value) of your choice between CPTS/CBBH/CDSA, so you should factor that into the cost of the subscription.


## If I get cubes with a monthly plan, do I lose them after the month?

No, any cubes you get in a subscription are yours to keep. The monthly subscriptions are a little confusing, but you can think of it more like a time gate. While you do get to keep the cubes, you are limited by a maximum of 1000/mo on the Platinum plan. With how few cubes most modules will cost you in the Penetration Tester path, and how long it will likely take you to go through those modules, it would be unlikely for you to finish modules faster than the cubes from a subscription will provide.


## What tool restrictions are there on the exam?

None!

## Is it okay to do modules in the course out of order?

Unless you already have significant experience with the course material, it's highly recommended that you complete the modules in the order that they are displayed on the 'job role paths' page. Many modules will make the assumption that you already have skills from previous modules in the order of the path, and if you are not familiar with the concepts, you might not be equipped to properly handle the content.


## What is 'AEN' that people in the community refer to?

AEN stands for 'Attacking Enterprise Networks', which is the final module of the 'Penetration Tester' path. This module is a mini penetration test, complete with a FULL walkthrough of all steps.


## What does it mean to do AEN 'blind'?

Many of us in the community often recommend doing the 'Attacking Enterprise Networks' module blind, to use it as a kind of practice test. When we say to do it 'blind', what we mean is to scroll to the bottom of the module, start the lab, and work through the lab as if you were going into the exam itself. The questions in the lab are spoilers to this themselves, and so you should avoid coming back to the module page until after you have successfully compromised any/all domains. This should give you a general idea of what the real exam will feel like, and let you know where you might have some gaps in the skills you've learned from the course.


## How hard is the exam compared to HTB boxes?

The academy uses a system for difficulty that is much the same as you'd expect from the main platform. In this way, the modules in the Penetration Tester path include 2 'Fundamental' modules, 11 'Easy' modules, and 15 'Medium' modules. The exam will reflect this difficulty just the same, and nothing on the exam would be out of place in an Easy/Medium machine on the main platform.
